		<strong>Information Sciences Instutute , ISI Rising Star Internship</strong> LA, California Sept 2022 - Present 
		<li>Selected in top 4 students of class of Fall 2022 to conduct research under principal researcher Prof. Carl Kesselman.
		<li> Designing database model for research modelling using <a href = "http://isrd.isi.edu/deriva/">Deriva </a> for scientific collaboration enabling real-time experimentation and research modelling for biomedical applications making capturing, managing and curating data seamless.
	<p>
		<strong>Software Engineer II</strong>. Cisco Systems Inc. Jan 2020 to July 2022 
		<br>
		<li>Worked with the Enterprise Service Platform Team and designed and built integrations between Cisco internal Services to automate activities helping save developer and management time.

		<strong>Samsung Research & Development Bengaluru</strong>. Bangalore. May 2019 - July 2019.
		<br>
		<li> Worked with the Samsung R&D Camera Divsion building a framework for tracking the memory and stack footprint of the Samsung Camera Application. This application was extended to be used throughout the organization for tracking the memory footprint of specified function during runtime and this helped to improve the developer producticity on complex issues of memory leak during runtime.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Center of Cloud Computing and Big Data</strong>. Bangalore. May 2018 - Dec 2018
		<li> Benchmarked Apache Cassandra on a Distributed setup using YSCB on real time workloads generated using various scenarios of real intensive and write internsive workloads to understand the parameters that most significantly affect system performace in an overloaded cluster. This was done to feature engineer the properties of the model proactively which would help to identify the most signifiant parameters affecting system performace using machine learning models.
