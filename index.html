	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I am an MS student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, Viterbi School of Engineering, looking out for full time opportunities for the Spring 2024. My areas of interest include DevOps, Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, and Security. During my work at Cisco, I have worked on developing libraries/frameworks for building integrations using services like REST, SOAP, and different protocols. I also have a strong working knowledge of ServiceNow Development, managing the Platform, and delivering custom solutions/integrations on top of the Platform. I have led small teams on different projects and helped them onboard solutions on our Platform. I am proficient with DevOps, CI/CD, and technologies like Docker, OpenStack, Kubernetes & Jenkins.
